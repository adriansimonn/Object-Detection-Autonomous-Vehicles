# Object-Detection-Autonomous-Vehicles
Final Project Code for Inspirit AI &amp; Stanford Alumni AI Scholars Program; Object Detection for Self Driving Vehicles (Computer Vision). Object detection algorithms to assist autonomous vehicles were created and studied during this group project in the Stanford Inspirit AI Program, written in Python.
Methods Used: CIFAR10 dataset, Tensorflow/Keras neural networks, transfer learning, convolutional neural networks, VGG-16 networks.

Employs a YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detector.
